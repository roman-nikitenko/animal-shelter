# Happy paws

Let me present you our project - a website for an Animal shelter.

My role in this project was create website from [designed by Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/HBbOBdVgqUnq2xv82Zb2sm/Pets-service-(Copy)?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design&t=dok2xsJXbSWYRTeZ-0). Create signIn and registration form with validation. Create own user place and separate access for admin.

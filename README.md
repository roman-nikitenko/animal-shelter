# Happy Paws API


The Happy Paws API is an application programming interface (API) developed to support the operations and management of an animal shelter. It consists of various services, each designed to address specific functionalities and requirements within the shelter system.


### Functions:

The Animals Service manages the catalog of animals within the shelter, facilitating operations such as animal intake, adoption, updating, and removal. Only authorized staff members have access to add or update animal information, while both authorized and unauthorized users can view the list of available animals.

The Adoptions Service is responsible for overseeing the adoption process for animals within the shelter. It handles the creation of adoption records, tracking the adopter's information, and updating the status of animals post-adoption.


* <i><strong>Users Service</strong></i>:
Registration: Users can create accounts by providing necessary details such as name, contact information, and preferred communication method.
Authentication: Users can log in using their credentials, and the API provides a token for subsequent authenticated requests.
User Profiles: Users have access to view and update their profile information, including preferences, previous adoptions, and communication subscriptions.


* <i><strong>Donations Service</strong></i>:
The Donations Service enables the processing of donations made to the animal shelter. It facilitates secure transactions and records all necessary information related to the donors and their contributions.


* <i><strong>Notifications Service (Email/SMS)</strong></i>:
